# Custom Campaign Tools
Custom Campaign Tools adds a wide range of Campaign-related features that modders can make use of. It provides a way to enhance campaign experiences, with features like ammo saving, save points, and achievements without being an absolute requirement for people playing the mod. Everything this mod adds is a "Quality of Life" addition, specifically designed around custom campaigns. 

Currently compatible with LabWorks + more at release, but any modders will have the ability to add these features to their own campaign. You can **download the SDK** from the github link here: https://github.com/EvroDeveloper/CustomCampaignTools.SDK/releases

The best way to learn about the SDK is to read it's README, as there are no official tutorials YET. Everything should be explained there pretty well.

## Features
 - **Main Menu Button**: Adds a button in the Main Menu to easily allow you to jump straight into a campaign.
 - **Ammo Saving**: The player's ammo count will have it's high score be saved throughout every main level, similar to how Boneworks saved ammo. 
 - **Inventory Saving**: The player's inventory can be enabled to save through levels of the campaign, with an option to filter for only certain items to be transfered.
 - **Save Points**: Campaigns can have Save Points and Continue Buttons to make it easy to continue right where you left off when playing
 - **Custom Load Scene, and Custom Loading Music** per campaign
 - **Cheat Restriction**: Dev Tools and Avatar Switching can be disabled and restricted until the player finishes the campaign for the first time. Avatars can be restricted to a single campaign avatar, or to a whitelist of valid ones.
 - **Unlockable Levels**: Levels can be set to unlock as you progress, making it so that the player cannot just skip around until they've played the campaign.
 - **Level Panel Tweaks**: Show the current campaign's levels first in the levels menu
 - **Achievements**: Modders can add achivements for fun if they want to
 - **Level Timing**: Keep track of how long you have spent in each level, and the campaign as a whole. Can be displayed if implemented
 - **Tac Trials**: Record tac trials and save your best times, if implemented

### I am completely open to any feature suggestions. If you have any ideas for campaign features, send them my way!
